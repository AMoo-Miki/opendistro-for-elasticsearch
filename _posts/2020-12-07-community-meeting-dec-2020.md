Join us on Monday, December 14th at 10am Pacific (UTC-7) through [Zoom](https://www.meetup.com/Open-Distro-for-Elasticsearch-Meetup-Group/events/thmcwrybcqbsb/) for a jam-packed meeting. This meeting will be our last of 2020 and we have a substantial agenda:

* Transforms RFC
* Cross Cluster Replication RFC
* Trace Analytics
* New Release

As always, we will go over the Open Distro for Elasticsearch roadmap and leave some time for questions and answers, however be aware that our time is limited in this session.

All are welcome to [join us](https://www.meetup.com/Open-Distro-for-Elasticsearch-Meetup-Group/events/thmcwrybcqbsb/)!
