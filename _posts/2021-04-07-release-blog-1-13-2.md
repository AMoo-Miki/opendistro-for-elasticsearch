We are delighted to release Open Distro for Elasticsearch 1.13.2 including general availability of Trace Analytics functionality. This release also resolves a bug related to several issues in index management. Open Distro for Elasticsearch 1.13.2 includes the Apache 2.0-licensed Elasticsearch and Kibana 7.10.2 as well as functionality for alerting, anomaly detection, performance analysis, security, SQL/PPL, k-NN and more. You can get started by visiting our [Getting Started & Downloads page](https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch/downloads.html).

## Trace Analytics

When you build increasingly complex, distributed applications that span multiple microservices and machines, a single operation from a user can set off a sequence of activity across this complex system. When everything is going well, this creates a robust, scalable application, however when your system is operating unexpectedly, the complexity makes for a challenging diagnosis. The challenge can be met by recording data on each operation as it moves through the service invocations, this data is known as a ‘trace’.

Trace Analytics is a Kibana plugin that provides you with visualizations of each individual trace execution across service invocations. It aggregates trace data into trace group and service map views, enabling you to monitor insights of your  application performance on trace data. This enables you to troubleshoot performance and availability issues in your distributed applications, giving end-to-end insights not possible with traditional methods of analyzing logs and metrics from each component and service separately. 

Trace Analytics supports [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/), a Cloud Native Computing Foundation project which provides a single set of APIs, libraries, agents, and collector services to capture distributed traces and metrics, enabling you to leverage Trace Analytics without having to re-instrument your applications. [Data Prepper](https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch/downloads.html#ingest), a beta component of Open Distro for Elasticsearch, converts trace information from a variety of application libraries and SDK’s into data directly usable with the Trace Analytics plugin. [Previously available](https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch/blog/releases/2020/12/announcing-trace-analytics/) as an experimental plugin, Trace Analytics is now a generally available component of Open Distro for Elasticsearch.


## Fixes

This version also resolves several related issues regarding `field_caps` interception logic in index management for remote cluster indices. Among other issues, this prevented the creation of time-based index patterns in multi-cluster architectures ([#418](https://github.com/opendistro-for-elasticsearch/index-management/issues/418)) as well as issues directly with the  `_field_caps` API.
