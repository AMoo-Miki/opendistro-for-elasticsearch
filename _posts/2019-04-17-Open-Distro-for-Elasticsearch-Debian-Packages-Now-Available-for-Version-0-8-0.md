You can now download Open Distro for Elasticsearch version 0.8.0 for Debian and Ubuntu environments. Open Distro for Elasticsearch 0.8.0 is built on the Apache 2.0 licensed versions of Elasticsearch and Kibana 6.6.2. See the [Open Distro for Elasticsearch downloads page](https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch/downloads.html) for instructions on how to download and install the .deb packages.

Note: [OpenJDK 11](https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch-docs/docs/install/deb/) is a pre-requisite.

With the addition of Debian support, you can now install Open Distro for Elasticsearch on the most popular Linux operating systems including CentOS, Fedora, RHEL, Amazon Linux, Ubuntu, and Debian, as well as using our pre-built Docker images.

If you have any questions on installation, please ask on the [Open Distro for Elastic search community forums](https://discuss.opendistrocommunity.dev/c/general-elasticsearch). You can also file an issue on the [Open Distro for Elasticsearch GitHub repo](https://github.com/opendistro-for-elasticsearch/community/issues).

We look forward to hearing from you!
