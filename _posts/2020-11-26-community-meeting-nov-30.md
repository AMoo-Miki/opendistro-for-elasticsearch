Join us on Monday, November 30th at 10am Pacific (UTC-7) through [Zoom](https://www.meetup.com/Open-Distro-for-Elasticsearch-Meetup-Group/events/thmcwrybcpbnc/) for another jampacked meeting. This focus topics will include:

* re:Invent sessions for the Open Distro crowd (continued)
* Asynchronous Search API RFC
* Downloads and Artifacts

As always, we will go over the Open Distro for Elasticsearch roadmap and leave some time for questions and answers.
