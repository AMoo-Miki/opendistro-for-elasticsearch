We've been having regular bi-weekly community meetings over Zoom at 10:00 AM Pacific on Mondays for quite some time.  While there has certainly been good response and attendance, we recognize that this time isn't ideal for our community members in India, Russia, Japan, South Korea, Australia, New Zealand, and everyone else located closer to the west side of the International Date Line.

Now through December 31, 2020, there is a poll over on [the Open Distro forums](https://discuss.opendistrocommunity.dev/) about times/days for these meetings. You can take part in this survey by [logging into the forum and voting on a day and time](https://discuss.opendistrocommunity.dev/t/2021-open-distro-community-meetings/4404). It only takes a second and it will really help us understand when we can reach the most community members.

Several possibilities are on the table:

* Keep the same time and day.
* Adopt a totally new time and day.
* Rotate times and days of the week.
* Have multiple meetings for different parts of the world.

If you have ideas how to best handle the meeting scheduling, [please vote and comment on our thread](https://discuss.opendistrocommunity.dev/t/2021-open-distro-community-meetings/4404). Your input on this keeps the project inclusive and helps us better understand the needs of our widely distributed community. 

Note: Due to the holidays and planned vacations, we **will not have a meeting on our normal cadence December 28, 2020**. Meetings will resume in early in the new year, hopefully with a new schedule.
