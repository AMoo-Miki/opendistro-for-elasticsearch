We've been having regular bi-weekly community meetings over Zoom at 10 am Pacific on Mondays for quite some time.  While there has certainly been good response and attendance, we recognize that this time could be less than ideal for those who live in timezones with a UTC greater than +4 (India and points west to the international dateline).

Now through December 31, 2020, there is a poll over on [the Open Distro forums](https://discuss.opendistrocommunity.dev/) about times/days for these meetings. You can take part in this survey by [logging into the forum and voting on a day and time](https://discuss.opendistrocommunity.dev/t/2021-open-distro-community-meetings/4404). It only takes a second and it will really help us understand when we can reach the most community members.

Several possibilities are on the table:

* keep it the same day of the week/time,
* adopt a totally new day of the week and/or time,
* rotate times and/or days of the week,
* have multiple meetings for different parts of the world.

If you have ideas how to best handle the meeting scheduling, [please vote and comment on our thread](https://discuss.opendistrocommunity.dev/t/2021-open-distro-community-meetings/4404). We welcome input on this important pillar of our community.

Note: Due to the holidays and planned vacation, we **will not have a meeting on our normal cadence (Dec 28, 2020)**. Meetings will resume in early in the new year, hopefully with a newly adopted schedule.
