Open Distro 1.13.3 is an important security update. You can get it now on [the download page](/for-elasticsearch/downloads.html). This version contains a patch to the [recently published](https://www.lunasec.io/docs/blog/log4j-zero-day/) security issue ([CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228)) which affects the broadly-used [Apache Log4j](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/) library used in Open Distro.

Open Distro 1.13.3 includes Linux .tar.gz (x64/arm64) and Windows .exe/.zip (x64) artifacts as well as a Docker image (x64). If you currently use the RPM or DEB distributions of Open Distro 1.13.2, the suggested mitigation is to set the JVM system property `log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups` to `true`  (e.g. add `-Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true` to the `ES_JAVA_OPTS` environment variable).
