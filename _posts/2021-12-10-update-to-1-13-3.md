Open Distro 1.13.3 is an important security update. You can get it now on [the download page](/for-elasticsearch/downloads.html). This version contains a patch to the [recently published](https://www.lunasec.io/docs/blog/log4j-zero-day/) security issue ([CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228)) which affects the broadly-used [Apache Log4j](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/) library used in Open Distro. For more information and context, see the [blog post on opensearch.org](https://opensearch.org/blog/releases/2021/12/update-to-1-2-1/).
