## New features in development

We‚Äôre also excited to pre-announce new plugins in development. We‚Äôve made available pre-release alpha versions of these plugin artifacts for developers (see below for links) to integrate into their applications. We invite you to join in to submit issues and PRs on features, bugs, and tests you need or build.

### k-NN Search

[Open Distro for Elasticsearch‚Äôs k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) search plugin](https://github.com/opendistro-for-elasticsearch/k-NN) will enable high-scale, low-latency nearest neighbor search on billions of documents across thousands of dimensions with the same ease as running any regular Elasticsearch query. The k-NN plugin relies on the [Non-Metric Space Library](https://github.com/nmslib/nmslib) (NMSLIB). It will power use cases such as recommendations, fraud detection, and related document search. We are extending the Apache Lucene codec to introduce a new file format to store vector data. k-NN search uses the standard Elasticsearch mapping and query syntax: to designate a field as a k-NN vector you simply map it to the new k-NN field type provided by the k-NN plugin.

### Index management

[Open Distro for Elasticsearch Index Management](https://github.com/opendistro-for-elasticsearch/index-management) will enable you to run periodic operations on your indexes, eliminating the need to build and manage external systems for these tasks. You will define custom policies to optimize and move indexes, applied based on wildcard index patterns. Policies are finite-state automata. Policies define states and transitions (Actions). The first release of Index Management will support force merge, delete, rollover, snapshot, replica_count, close/open, read_only/read_write actions, and more. Index Management will be configurable via REST or the associated Kibana plugin. We‚Äôve made artifacts of the alpha version of [Open Distro for Elasticsearch Index Management](https://github.com/opendistro-for-elasticsearch/index-management/releases/tag/alpha-rc1) and [Open Distro for Elasticsearch Kibana Index Management](https://github.com/opendistro-for-elasticsearch/index-management-kibana-plugin/releases/tag/alpha-rc1) available on GitHub.

### Job scheduler

[Open Distro for Elasticsearch‚Äôs Job Scheduler plugin](https://discuss.opendistrocommunity.dev/t/open-distro-for-elasticsearch-adds-a-job-scheduler/775) is a library that enables you to build plugins that can run periodic jobs on your cluster. You can use Job Scheduler for a variety of use cases, from taking snapshots once per hour, to deleting indexes more than 90 days old, to providing scheduled reports. Read our [announcement page for Open Distro for Elasticsearch Job Scheduler](https://discuss.opendistrocommunity.dev/t/open-distro-for-elasticsearch-adds-a-job-scheduler/775) for more details.

### SQL Kibana UI

Open Distro for Elasticsearch‚Äôs Kibana UI for SQL will make it easier for you to run SQL queries and explore your data. This plugin will support SQL syntax highlighting and output results in the familiar tabular format. The SQL Kibana UI will support nested documents, allowing you to expand columns with these documents and drill down into the nested data. You will also be able to translate your SQL query to Elasticsearch query DSL with a single click and download results of the query as a CSV file.
