**Update:** Open Distro for Elasticsearch 1.13.0 shipped without the Performance Analyzer active in TAR and Docker formats. Additionally, the security plugin included in 1.13.0 threw errors on `_cat/health` calls and introduced a performance regression when compared to 1.12. Version 1.13.1 was released on March 4th, 2021 to re-enable Performance Analyzer as well as resolve the error and the performance regression in the security plugin.

We are pleased to release [Open Distro for Elasticsearch 1.13.0](https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch/downloads.html) with new features including asynchronous search, a historical data analysis feature for Anomaly Detection, the ability to run on ARM processors, and new SQL capabilities. You can grab a copy from our [Getting Started & Downloads page](https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch/downloads.html).

Open Distro for Elasticsearch 1.13.0 includes version 7.10.2 of open source Elasticsearch and Kibana, plus Apache 2.0-licensed plugins that provide alerting, anomaly detection, index management, performance analysis, security, SQL, k-NN, and more. Other components, including ODBC and JDBC drivers, a command line SQL client, and a command line performance visualization tool (“PerfTop”) are also available to download.

## Asynchronous search
[**Asynchronous search**](https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch-docs/docs/async/) lets you run queries across large data sets, or data sets that span multiple clusters, and allows Elasticsearch clients to receive results as they become available. With the new asynchronous search capability you can run non-blocking queries in the background, avoiding failures by resource exhaustion or client timeouts. You can monitor the progress of long running searches, obtain partial results, and save the results to an index for later examination.

## Historical data analysis in anomaly detection

**Historical data analysis** is now available in [Anomaly Detection](https://opendistro.github.io/for-elasticsearch-docs/docs/ad/). With this feature, you can analyze and apply machine learning models over long historical data windows to identify anomaly patterns, seasonality, and trends.

## ARM processor support
You can now run Open Distro for Elasticsearch on **64-bit** **ARM processors**. ARM support has been one of the most requested features for Open Distro, and is another step toward making it easy to deploy and run on premises or in the cloud on the architecture of your choice. People are excited about the improvements to power consumption and performance of ARM-based server architectures. In our own testing, switching to ARM yielded a 20-28% performance increase for representative workloads. ARM builds of ODFE are available alongside X64 builds on the download page.

## SQL enhancements and additional capabilities

Starting with Open Distro 1.13, you can use [identifier names containing special characters](https://github.com/opendistro-for-elasticsearch/sql/blob/develop/docs/user/general/identifiers.rst). You can specify [date and interval types](https://github.com/opendistro-for-elasticsearch/sql/blob/develop/docs/user/general/datatypes.rst), and use [date and time functions](https://github.com/opendistro-for-elasticsearch/sql/blob/develop/docs/user/dql/functions.rst). The SQL engine now supports complex [nested expressions](https://github.com/opendistro-for-elasticsearch/sql/blob/develop/docs/user/dql/expressions.rst), and lets you perform queries that contain the [HAVING clause without GROUP BY](https://github.com/opendistro-for-elasticsearch/sql/blob/develop/docs/user/dql/aggregations.rst#having-without-group-by) and [subqueries in FROM clauses](https://github.com/opendistro-for-elasticsearch/sql/blob/develop/docs/user/dql/complex.rst#example-2-subquery-in-from-clause). With the [FILTER clause](https://github.com/opendistro-for-elasticsearch/sql/blob/develop/docs/user/dql/aggregations.rst#filter-clause), you can set specific conditions for your aggregation bucket. You can use the [ORDER BY clause](https://github.com/opendistro-for-elasticsearch/sql/blob/develop/docs/user/dql/basics.rst#example-2-specifying-order-for-null) to specify the order of documents with missing fields either before or after the documents containing no missing fields.  You can also use [ORDER BY](https://github.com/opendistro-for-elasticsearch/sql/blob/develop/docs/user/dql/basics.rst#example-3-ordering-by-aggregate-functions) clause on aggregate functions, and perform [aggregations on expressions](https://github.com/opendistro-for-elasticsearch/sql/blob/develop/docs/user/dql/basics.rst#example-3-ordering-by-aggregate-functions). Finally, with enhanced [PartiQL (JSON) support](https://github.com/opendistro-for-elasticsearch/sql/blob/develop/docs/user/beyond/partiql.rst#example-2-selecting-deeper-levels), you can query object fields at deeper levels.
