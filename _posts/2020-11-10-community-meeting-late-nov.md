Join us on Monday, November 16th at 10am Pacific (UTC-7) through [Zoom](https://www.meetup.com/Open-Distro-for-Elasticsearch-Meetup-Group/events/thmcwrybcpbvb/) for another great meeting. This meeting has an especially long list of focus topics which includes:

* re:Invent sessions for the Open Distro crowd
* Kibana Notebooks _Note: This was shifted from last meeting_
* SQL Improvements
* Alerting Security

As always, we will go over the Open Distro for Elasticsearch roadmap and leave some time for questions and answers.

All are welcome to [join us](https://www.meetup.com/Open-Distro-for-Elasticsearch-Meetup-Group/events/thmcwrybcpbvb/)!
