Want to craft your own Docker images using Open Distro for Elasticsearch build scripts? Or build your RPM or Debian packages to customize your own Open Distro for Elasticsearch stack? Our build scripts [for Elasticsearch](https://github.com/opendistro-for-elasticsearch/opendistro-build/tree/master/elasticsearch) and [for Kibana](https://github.com/opendistro-for-elasticsearch/opendistro-build/tree/master/kibana) are now available for you to do just that.

As with the rest of Open Distro for Elasticsearch, you can use, modify and contribute to these scripts. Check them out, build your images, and modify and adapt them for your use case!
