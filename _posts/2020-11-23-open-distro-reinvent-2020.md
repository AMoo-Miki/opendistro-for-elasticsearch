One of the biggest tech conferences in the world is [AWS re:Invent](http://reinvent.awsevents.com/). In a typical year, the event is held after the US Thanksgiving holiday in Las Vegas as an intense, week-long event with people from around the world presenting on a variety of topics all relating back to AWS. A typical year 2020 is not and this extends to the format of re:Invent. Like many other conferences, it has gone full virtual for 2020 yielding two silver linings: there is no registration fee and you don’t have to travel. The other change is that it’s a more relaxed pace across several weeks.

What has stayed the same is the sheer volume of sessions to attend. If you’re interested in Open Distro for Elasticsearch there are definitely sessions that will be relevant. To better understand the session catalog, let’s break down the sessions into three categories from more broad to more specific: sessions in the same domain, Amazon Elasticsearch Service sessions, and Open Distro for Elasticsearch sessions. This list is a small fraction of the overall slate of sessions being presented at re:Invent and many of these have replay times to better suit your time zone - check out the session catalogue at [reinvent.awsevents.com](http://reinvent.awsevents.com/) for full details. 

## Same-domain sessions

These sessions are not directly related to Open Distro for Elasticsearch but are likely to be in the same general interest area. First up, you have **Andy Jassy’s keynote** on December 1st. As CEO of AWS, Andy's sessions are always informative for the entire technology sector and can set conversations for the rest of the year. Another keynote session to keep an eye on is **Werner Vogels** (VP & CTO of Amazon) on December 15. Werner’s sessions are usually quite tech focused and, like Andy’s, have an industry-wide ripple effect. 

Observability is a key use case of Open Distro for Elasticsearch so it’s natural to want to pay attention to the session **Open-source observability at AWS** on December 3rd. This session covers [Open Telemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/), which is definitely something to keep your eye on. If you attend one leadership session, make it Rahul Pathak’s session **Harness the power of data with AWS analytics** on December 9th. Rahul leads analytics at AWS and both the AWS Open Distro for Elasticsearch and Amazon Elasticsearch Service engineering teams fall under him, so they’re both likely to get some coverage. 

## Amazon Elasticsearch Service sessions

Amazon Elasticsearch Service is based on Open Distro for Elasticsearch and while not everything applies between the two, there is certainly nuggets of knowledge to be mined from these sessions. On December 15, **Security overview for Amazon Elasticsearch Service** will give you a good basis of knowledge on the security plugin which is shared between Open Distro and the service. **What’s new in Amazon Elasticsearch Service** on December 17 will go over features in the service, most of which are available in Open Distro, so it would be a great session for those who are new to the feature set of Open Distro. 

The next pair of sessions are very timely. On December 2, the session **How Vyaire uses AWS analytics to scale ventilator production & save lives** shares the story of how a ventilator manufacturer used tools like Amazon Elasticsearch Service to scale up after demand skyrocketed during the pandemic. Along a similar thread, **How Erickson Living built a COVID-19 outbreak management solution** (December 8) covers the journey to build an infectious disease management system using services including Amazon Elasticsearch Service. 

A there are a couple other industry stories about the use of Elasticsearch that have nothing to do with the pandemic. On November 30, you can checkout **Building a connected factory with Volkswagen**, where the automotive giant chronicles how analytics services like Amazon Elasticsearch Service was used to alter the company’s manufacturing and logistics processes. **Modernize log analytics with Amazon Elasticsearch Service** on December 16 covers Capital One’s use of Amazon Elasticsearch Service to build end-to-end log analytics. 

## Open Distro for Elasticsearch

The November 30th session **Using Open Distro for Elasticsearch for developer analytics** is a great example of a solution built on Open Distro for Elasticsearch from [Cauldron.io](http://cauldron.io/). This session not only is relevant to Open Distro, it also dives into gaining insights from developer activity in the open source projects. 

re:Invent 2020 is a great opportunity to be able to take in a ton of sessions connected to the space that Open Distro for Elasticsearch occupies. Being fully virtual, it is also a good time to get a sample of what a conference like re:Invent offers without the cost or time commitment of going in-person. Hopefully you can find some sessions in these and beyond that can help you learn a bit more or find a solution to a problem that you are having.
