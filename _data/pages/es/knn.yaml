  subtitle: Open Distro for Elasticsearch

intro:
  title: Build efficient similarity search architecture<br> using k-Nearest Neighbor Search
  ext_content: Open Distro for Elasticsearch k-NN plugin enables users to run nearest neighbor search on billions of documents across thousands of dimensions with the same ease as running any regular Elasticsearch query. Use aggregations and filter clauses to further refine your similarity search operations. Power uses cases such as product recommendations, fraud detection, image and video search, related document search, and more.

features:
  - title: Integrated with NMSLIB
    content: The k-NN plugin leverages the lightweight open source library Non-Metric Space Library (<a href="https://github.com/nmslib/nmslib">NMSLIB</a>) that implements the approximate k-NN search based on Hierarchical Navigable Small world (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.09320.pdf">HNSW</a>) graphs. NMSLIB is a highly efficient implementation of k-NN, which has consistently out-performed most of the other solutions as per the ANN-Benchmarks published <a href="https://github.com/erikbern/ann-benchmarks">here</a>. NMSLIB can be easily extended to add new search methods and distance functions.

  - title: New k-NN codec and datatype
    content: The solution has extended Lucene codec to introduce a separate file format for storing and retrieving k-NN indices to deliver high efficiency k-NN search operations on Elasticsearch.  Datasets in k-NN are vectors that are represented in Elasticsearch fields by the new datatype called knn_vector. This vector can support a single list of up to 10,000 floats.

  - title: Combine with other Elasticsearch features
    content: k-NN functionality integrates seamlessly with other Elasticsearch features. This provides users the flexibility to use Elasticsearch’s extensive search features such as aggregations and filtering with k-NN to further slice and dice the data to increase the precision of the searches.

alerts:
  title: Performance at scale
  text: By leveraging Elasticsearch’s distributed architecture, k-NN plugin can ingest large datasets, support incremental updates and efficiently process the machine learning model, thereby delivering a highly performant and scalable similarity search engine.
