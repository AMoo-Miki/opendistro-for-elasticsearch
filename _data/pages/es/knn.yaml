  subtitle: Open Distro for Elasticsearch

intro:
  title: Build efficient similarity search architecture<br> using k-Nearest Neighbor Search 
  ext_content: K-nearest neighbor (KNN) search, widely used for similarity search and image recognition, finds the nearest K points in a vector space by Euclidean distance. With the new KNN plugin support in Open Distro for Elasticsearch, users can submit the K-dimensional vector as a field in the Elasticsearch documents and fetch nearest neighbors for a given point using the Elasticsearch query syntax.

features:
  - title: Integrated with NMSLIB
    content: The KNN plugin leverages the lightweight open source library Non-Metric Space Library (<a href="https://github.com/nmslib/nmslib">NMSLIB</a>) that implements the approximate kNN search based on Hierarchical Navigable Small world(<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.09320.pdf">HNSW</a>) graphs. NMSLIB can be easily extended to add new search methods and distance functions.

  - title: New KNN codec and datatype
    content: The plugin introduces a new KNN codec in Lucene for handling storage and retrieval of data. Datasets in KNN are vectors that are represented in Elasticsearch fields by the new datatype called knn_vector. This vector can support a single list of up to 10000 float values.

  - title: Efficient queries
    content: Users can seamlessly do KNN search with their data using the new ‘knn’ clause in the query DSL. They can further improve the results by combining KNN query with the existing Elasticsearch queries.

alerts:
  title: Performance at scale
  text: By leveraging Elasticsearch’s distributed architecture, KNN plugin can ingest large datasets, support incremental updates and efficiently process the machine learning model, thereby delivering a highly performant similarity search engine.
