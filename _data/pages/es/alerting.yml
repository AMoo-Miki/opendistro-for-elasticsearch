  title: Monitor and receive alerts on your data
  ext_content: Open Distro for Elasticsearch enables you to monitor your data and send alert notifications automatically to your stakeholders. With an intuitive Kibana interface and powerful API, it is easy to set up, manage and monitor your alerts. By exposing Elasticsearch's full query language and scripting capabilities, so you can craft highly specific alert conditions.

features:
  - title: Create monitors
    content: It's easy to create monitors using the Kibana UI with our simple visual editor or with an Elasticsearch query, giving you the flexibility to query for the data most interesting to you. In other words if you can query for something in Elasticsearch, you can monitor and alert on it. For instance, if you are ingesting access logs, you could be notified when the same user logs in from multiple different locations within an hour, enabling you to proactively address possible intrusion attempts.

  - title: Configure your trigger conditions
    content: Trigger conditions allow you to define the thresholds and severity to alert on. Each monitor can have multiple trigger conditions enabling your to query the data once and generate the appropriate action given the severity of the trigger condition met. Triggers, like monitors, are highly customizable and can be created using a simple visual editor or sophisticated Painless scripts.
