  title: Monitor and receive alerts on your data
  ext_content: Open Distro for Elasticsearch enables you to monitor your data and send alert notifications automatically to your stakeholders. With an intuitive Kibana interface and a powerful API, it is easy to set up, manage, and monitor your alerts. Craft highly specific alert conditions using Elasticsearch's full query language and scripting capabilities.

features:
  - title: Easily create monitors
    content: With Open Distro for Elastisearch, you can easily create monitors using the Kibana UI with a simple visual editor or with an Elasticsearch query. This gives you the flexibility to query the data most interesting to you and receive alerts on it. For instance, if you are ingesting access logs, you can choose to be notified when the same user logs in from multiple locations within an hour, enabling you to proactively address possible intrusion attempts.

  - title: Customize multiple alert conditions
    content: Trigger conditions allow you to define the alerting threshold and severity. Each monitor can have multiple trigger conditions, enabling you to query the data once and generate the appropriate action. Triggers, like monitors, are highly customizable and can be created using a simple visual editor or Painless scripts.
