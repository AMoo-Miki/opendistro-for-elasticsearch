intro:
  title: Why Open Distro for Elasticsearch?
  text: Elasticsearch has become an essential technology for search and machine generated data analytics. Developers and engineers world-wide rely on open-source Elasticsearch to gain timely insights into their applications, infrastructure and security. As Elasticsearch has evolved, there has been significant intermingling of proprietary code into the project creating a lack of clarity as to what developers who care about open-source can depend on. Open Distro for Elasticsearch ensures that open-source Elasticsearch innovation continues to thrive by providing a fully features open-source, community-driven distribution that makes it easy for everyone to use, collaborate, and contribute to-without restrictions.
