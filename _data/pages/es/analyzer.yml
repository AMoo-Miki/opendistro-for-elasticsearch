intro:
  title: Get deep diagnostic insights into your cluster
  ext_content: Performance Analyzer enables unprecedented visibility into system bottlenecks by providing a powerful REST API for querying Elasticsearch metrics alongside detailed network, disk and operating system stats. Additionally, Performance Analyzer operates independently of Elasticsearch enabling you to perform diagnostics, even when your cluster is under duress. 
  
features:
  - title: Perform diagnostics across the stack
    content: Performance Analyzer provides a powerful REST API for querying Elasticsearch metrics and their consumption of network, disk and operating system resources. This visibility gives you the ability to identify system bottlenecks at all layers of the stack.
