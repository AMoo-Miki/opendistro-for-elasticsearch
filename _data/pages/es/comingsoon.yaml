  - title: Index Management

It will offer index automation to simplify managing indexes, while providing a Kibana based administrative panel for monitoring and managing indexes.

  - title: SQL Kibana Plug-in 
    content: Trigger conditions allow you to define the alerting threshold and severity. Each monitor can have multiple trigger conditions, enabling you to query the data once and generate the appropriate action. Triggers, like monitors, are highly customizable and can be created using a simple visual editor or Painless scripts.

    content: Open Distro for Elasticsearch provides multiple alerting options with built-in integrations for webhook and Slack. Webhook support integrates with your existing monitoring infrastructure or any third-party system. You can format alerts using Mustache to embed relevant information in the notifications to ensure your team knows what to do when they get them.
