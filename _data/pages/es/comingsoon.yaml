features:
  - title: Index Management
    content: We are working on a new integrated job engine for Open Distro for Elasticsearch, Index Management. With Index Management, you will be able to run periodic operations on your indexes, eliminating the need build and manage external systems for these tasks. Index Management will enable you to defining custom policies, to optimize and move indices and apply them to index patterns. Each policy contains a default state and a list of states that you define for the index to transition between. Within each state you can define a list of actions to perform and transitions to enter a new state. Actions supported in the initial release of Index State Management include force merge, shrink split, allocation, snapshot, delete, rollover and more. Index Management will be configurable via REST or the associated Kibana plugin.

    content: Trigger conditions allow you to define the alerting threshold and severity. Each monitor can have multiple trigger conditions, enabling you to query the data once and generate the appropriate action. Triggers, like monitors, are highly customizable and can be created using a simple visual editor or Painless scripts.

    content: Open Distro for Elasticsearch provides multiple alerting options with built-in integrations for webhook and Slack. Webhook support integrates with your existing monitoring infrastructure or any third-party system. You can format alerts using Mustache to embed relevant information in the notifications to ensure your team knows what to do when they get them.
