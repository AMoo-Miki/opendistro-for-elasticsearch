You love Elasticsearch, you’ve found a hidden gem and want to share it with everyone. Can you participate in the blog and generate your own post? We have some simple guidelines that will make the process fast and painless.

### Some basic rules on the content:

1. Original - You should be the author or authors of the content you’re submitting.
2. Images - Make sure all images you are submitted are either your work or under a shareable (Creative Commons) license.
3. Links - The Open Distro editorial team will be the final approver for all links in your article. 
4. Content License - Your article must be licensed with a Creative Commons license (_https://creativecommons.org/licenses/_ (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/)) for publication on the Open Distro blog.
5. Content Copyright - You (as the author) hold copyright to your article.
6. Document Format - You can submit your article in markdown format (.md) or .odt, .txt or .docx. If you submit a Google Doc, do not edit it after you submit it.

### Some basic rules on syntax and layout:

1. Grammar and spelling: Use a spell checker before submitting your article. Also, make sure sentences are en-us locale ready. Don’t use profanity.
2. Word count: Don’t worry about word count. If the article is too long, it might work better as a multi-part article. 
3. Links: Make sure links include “target=_blank” for opening a new window.
4. Source code and terminal commands: Use <code> tags.
5. Images: Provide all lead and inline images in high resolution, with credits, alt text, and captions. Please make sure the image format is PNG or JPG/JPEG.

### Article Acceptance:

All decisions of the Open Distro blog editorial team for article acceptance are final and binding.
